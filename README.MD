# SpringSecurity-Homework

This is the homework archive of my undergraduate course "Software Security". 

My work of this project is backend security design and backend coding.

+ RBAC: Based on spring security framework, our app has good authentication and access control.
+ Secutiry Design: Formal design and verification of software security was performed.
+ Security Deployment: Some mandatory security policy was performed.

Due to the time constraints of the course and limited personal abilities, the code is rather rough and is for students' reference only.

I am very grateful for your criticisms and corrections.
